# Customised-Virtual-File-System-CVFS-

ðŸ”—Project Overview

    This project is a custom implementation of a Virtual File System (VFS) that simulates the core functionality of the Linux file system. 
    It is built entirely in C, with its own custom shell to interact with the virtual environment.
    The project provides a practical understanding of system calls, file handling, memory management, andÂ OSÂ internals

ðŸ”—Key Features

    â€¢ Custom Shell interface

        Â° Provides Linux-like commands for file operations (create, open, read, write, delete,Â ls,Â etc.)

    â€¢ System call simulation

        Â° Implements core Linux file system calls (open, read, write, lseek, close, rm,Â etc.)Â usingÂ C

     â€¢ File System Data Structure

        Â° In-core Inode Table
        Â° File Table
        Â° UAREA (user area)
        Â° User File DescriptorÂ Table

     â€¢ Platform independent

          Â° Allows Linux-style system-level file handling to be used on any operating system

          
     â€¢ Database-like Functionality

            Â° Provides a customised database management layer with structuredÂ fileÂ handling

  ðŸ”—   Learning Outcomes
  
       Â° Deep understanding of Linux File System internals
       Â° Practical knowledge of data structures used in OS (inode, file tables, UAREA)
       Â° Strong grasp of system programming in C
       Â° Hands-on experience with shell design & command interpreters
       Â° Application of low-level logic building for OS-likeÂ environments
